# TASK: Invite-member dashboard UI + public accept-invite page

## 0 · GROUND — the real codebase ▸ docs/02-the-flow.md

Touches (files · symbols · signatures): <path:symbol — what it is / how it is keyed>
Context (working folder): <docs · todos · config · data the task touches — task-delta only>
Honors (patterns / conventions): <PROJECT.md / CONVENTIONS.md anchors — task-delta only, never a re-scan>
Seams consulted: <SEAMS.md entry cited instead of re-deriving, e.g. .add/SEAMS.md#scope-token-grammar — optional, omit if none apply>
Anchors the contract cites: <the symbols §3 will name>
Issues/Risks (→ feed §1): <problems · traps · untestable risks found in the real code — task-delta; §1 builds on these>
Related intent: <PROJECT.md § · GLOSSARY term(s) · originating request/milestone rationale — the WHY; task-delta>
Ground SHA: <`git rev-parse --short HEAD` at ground time — cite symbols, not bare line numbers; any line ref is "as of" this commit>

---

## 1 · SPECIFY — the rules ▸ docs/03-step-1-specify.md

Feature: <name>
Framings weighed: <chosen> (chosen) · <alternative> · <alternative>
Must:
<must>
  - <required behavior>
</must>
Reject:
<reject>
  - <bad input / situation> -> "<error_code>"
</reject>
After:
<after>
  - <state that is true once it succeeds>
</after>
Assumptions — lowest-confidence first:
<assumptions>
  ⚠ <the one assumption most likely to be wrong> — lowest confidence because <why>; if wrong: <cost>
  - [ ] <next assumption, ranked> — confirm or deny; never carry an open one forward
</assumptions>

---

## 2 · SCENARIOS — pass/fail cases ▸ docs/04-step-2-scenarios.md

<scenarios>

```gherkin
Scenario: <short name>   # <Must/Reject item this covers, e.g. M1 or R1>
  Given <starting situation>
  When <action>
  Then <expected result>
  And <what must remain unchanged>   # required for every rejection
```

</scenarios>

---

## 3 · CONTRACT — freeze the shape ▸ docs/05-step-3-contract.md

```
<METHOD> <path>   body: { <fields> }
  200 -> { <success fields> }
  4xx -> { error: "<code>" | "<code>" }
Schema: <tables/fields touched, and access pattern>
```

Glossary deltas: <new domain term(s) this task introduces, `Term: definition` — or "none">
Status: DRAFT
Reported: <yes — the freeze report (banner/ARC/SHAPE) rendered before this froze | no>

---

## 4 · TESTS — failing-first suite (red) ▸ docs/06-step-4-tests.md

Coverage target: <e.g. 90%>
Plan (one test per scenario, asserting behavior not internals):
<test_plan>
  - test_<scenario>: arrange <Given> / act <When> / assert <Then> + assert <unchanged> · covers: <M#, R:code — optional>
</test_plan>

Tests live in: `./tests/` · MUST run red (missing implementation) before Build.

---

## 5 · BUILD — AI writes code ▸ docs/07-step-5-build.md

Scope (may touch): `./src/`   <fill before the §3 freeze — every file the build may write>
Strategy (ordered batches): <1. … 2. … — the planned build order; guidance, not enforced; preferred architecture/pattern strategies; advise solution/method to resolve issues/implement features; let the named Persona's domain stance (below) shape the approach, not just architecture patterns>

Persona (required): <name the persona file under `.add/personas/` this build embodies as a domain stance atop SOUL.md — advisory, never lowers a gate; name "generic" if no project persona fits yet>
Spawn isolation (default): <prefer isolation: "worktree" for any subagent build/verify spawn, not only explicit parallel mode; shared-tree needs a stated reason — see worktree-isolated-spawn-default>
Known-problem fixes: <trap → planned fix — the failure modes this build must dodge; guidance, not enforced>
Strategy actually used: <fill at VERIFY — the strategy you ACTUALLY used (or "as planned"); harvested into the §7 Decisions (ADR) block as the [AI] build decision>
Safety rule (feature-specific): <e.g. debit+credit in one atomic transaction>
Code lives in: `./src/`
Constraints: do NOT change any test or the contract; allow-list packages only; ask if unclear.

## 6 · VERIFY — evidence + non-functional review ▸ docs/08-step-6-verify.md

- [ ] all tests pass
- [ ] coverage did not decrease
- [ ] no test or contract was altered during build
- [ ] the green was EARNED, not gamed — no overfit to fixtures, vacuous asserts, or stubbed-away logic (score with an adversarial refute-read — a subagent recommended under `autonomy: auto`; a confirmed cheat is HARD-STOP)
- [ ] concurrency / timing of the risky operation is safe
- [ ] no exposed secrets, injection openings, or unexpected dependencies
- [ ] layering & dependencies follow CONVENTIONS.md
- [ ] a person reviewed and approved the change

### Build expectations — what "correct" looks like (fill BEFORE build; confirm each at the gate)
> OBSERVABLE outcomes a correct build must produce, derived from the §2 scenarios + §3 contract — evidence you can SEE, not test names.
- [ ] <observable outcome a correct build must produce> — confirmed by <how / where>
- [ ] <another observable outcome> — confirmed by <evidence seen>

### Deep checks — do not skim (fill the path that applies; the resolver judges which)
- [ ] WIRING (code) — every new symbol is referenced; record where / how confirmed
- [ ] DEAD-CODE (code) — no new unused or orphaned symbol introduced
- [ ] SEMANTIC (prose / non-code) — read in full, not skimmed: <what read · what confirmed>

### Live-verify evidence — confirm the §0 GROUND anchors still resolve (fill at the gate)
> Re-resolve every symbol §3 cites against the CURRENT tree (code moved since Ground SHA) — catch a stale anchor here, not later.
- [ ] every symbol §3 CONTRACT cites still resolves in the current tree — confirmed by <how / where>
- [ ] any anchor that moved/renamed since Ground SHA is named here, not left silent

### Refute-read verdict — the earned-green check (record it; required for an auto-PASS)
> Under auto, record the earned-green refute-read (the engine never spawns it — you do; NOT-EARNED -> `add.py heal`). Audit-measured (`refute_unrecorded`), never blocked; a human spot-audit is the backstop.
Verdict: <EARNED | NOT-EARNED>
By: <self | agent-id> · adversarially checked: <what was probed>

### Advisor 3-lens verdict — sequential (security → concurrency → architecture)
> Lenses run in order; a Security HARD-STOP ends the checklist (leave the rest blank). Binding for sensitivity: mechanical (advisor-gate-relax); advisory otherwise. Audit-measured (`advisor_verdict_unrecorded`), never blocked.
Advisor: <agent-id | self>
1. Security: <CLEAR | HARD-STOP: finding>
2. Concurrency: <CLEAR | RESIDUE: finding>
3. Architecture: <CLEAR | RESIDUE: finding>
Verdict: <PASS | HARD-STOP>
Residue: <none | summary>
Binding: <yes — mechanical | advisory — <sensitivity>>

### GATE RECORD
Reported: <yes — the gate report (banner/ARC) rendered before this outcome recorded | no>
Outcome: PASS
If RISK-ACCEPTED -> owner: <name> · ticket: <link> · expires: <date>   (never for a security gap)

## 7 · OBSERVE — feed the next loop ▸ docs/09-the-loop.md

Watch (reuse scenarios as monitors): <error rate / per-rejection rate / latency>

### Decisions (ADR)
- [AI] specify — chose <unrecorded>
- [human] freeze — froze §3 @ <unrecorded> (approved by <unrecorded>)
- [AI] build — strategy used: as planned
- [AI] verify — gate PASS (reviewed by Tin Dang)

### Spec delta
One line per forward change, tagged `[SPEC · open|seeded|dropped]` + evidence — each re-enters at Specify (`deltas.md`).

### Competency deltas
One lesson per line: `[DDD|SDD|UDD|TDD|ADD · open] the learning (evidence: …)` — see `deltas.md`.
